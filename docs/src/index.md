@flow








This is a sample project to show how we can run lint, automated test,
code coverage and inline documentation, type checks.


  

```

import logger from './utilities/logger';
import { Person } from './sub/species';

```







learn about [species](./sub/species.html) or learn directly about [pet](./sub/species.html#pet) which is in species too.








Jack should always born before Jane


  

```
const jack = Person.init({ name: 'Jack', age: 36 });
const jane = Person.init({ name: 'Jane', age: 30 });

const people: Array<Person> = [jack, jane];


```







It is **important** to know we never show Jane's age as she is sensitive!

```
people.forEach((value: Person) => {
  if (value.name !== 'Jane') {
    console.log(value.info());
  } else {
    logger.error('Jane will be pissed!');
  }
});


```
